Hi there! My name is Chris Zacny and I'm a Software Engineer in the Greater Seattle Area. I am also an Amateur Pianist/Musician, Outdoor Explorer and most importantly, Husband / Dad. This blog intends to be a catalog of my adventures/journeys in addition to various topics I find interesting. I hope you enjoy it!
