Hi there! 

My name is Chris Zacny, and I'm a Software Engineer in the Greater Seattle Area. 

I am also an Amateur Pianist, Avid Outdoors Explorer, Husband, and Dad. 

This blog intends to be a catalog of my adventures / journeys in addition to various topics I find interesting. 

I hope you enjoy it!
