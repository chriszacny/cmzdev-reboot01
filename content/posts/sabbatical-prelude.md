In April of 2023, my employer announced there would be layoffs. There had been downsizings / restructurings before, and during those time periods I always felt pretty secure given I was significantly exceeding expectations and contributing to core business problems. This time however, it felt different; our CEO mentioned even those significantly exceeding could be impacted. And in the end, I was one of the people let go; likely because I had shifted to more R&D work vs core business work.

In some ways I felt relieved; now I would have time to focus on academic endeavors like focusing more on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and diving into some [Machine Learning / AI](https://www.statlearning.com/). On the other hand, I would no longer be receiving that steady paycheck that I've been used to over the last twenty years. Additionally, the tech industry is clearly going through the motions of [Newton's Third Law](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/newtons-laws-of-motion/#newtons-third-law-action-reaction); there was undoubtedly overhiring last year, and it has become disturbingly clear that all the tech companies are intertwined; at least from a US Capitalism / Investor perspective. Thus, if __one big firm__ does layoffs, __all the tech firms__ tends to do layoffs.

All that said, I have resolved to be optimistic and use this opportunity as a true Sabbatical.

During this time, I'd like to do the following:

* Spend time with my Wife doing cool stuff like peaceful morning walks, tea tastings, art museums, and such
* Volunteer with my daughters' Girl Scout Troops Summer events
* Camping and fun summer outings with family
* Continued focus on physical and mental fitness (trail running, hiking, cycling, strength training, daily mindfulness work)
* Volunteer for the Washington Trail Association
* Several significant backpacking trips
* Introduction to Machine Learning as per above
* Functional programming
* OSS Contributions and Work
* Attend one tech meetup / conference per week
* Network with former co-workers and keep in touch
* When Sabbatical is concluding: Interview prep, Leetcoding, and interviews

Phew. That's a lot. There is no way I'll be able to do all of that, but the family and health items are "must dos". I'd also like to treat the outdoor activities like backpacking, trail running, etc. as must dos because this is a time to reacharge, and that is typically what works for me (long periods of time outside). The rest of the items are important, but incidental. The last item is also a must do, but I'll do that near the end of my Sabbatical time.

My overall daily plan is to leverage [Cal Newport's Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) methods and get at least two hours of deep knowledge work (unpaid) in per day; such as Leetcoding, OSS contributions, ML learning, etc, as long as no volunteer / family tasks are scheduled that day. By doing two hours of daily deep work, this will ensure my professional skills (Coding, SRE, Design and Architecture, etc.) stay sharp. 

I put a two hour limit on the deep work though; I want to make sure I go back to work after this period fully recharged (well, at least "mostly" recharged; "fully" may be a pipe dream) and ready to contribute to something cool again. For me, that's going to require days of hiking in the mountains, swimming in a river with the family, and so forth.

My hope is that by taking this approach, a "north star" or some sort of "compass bearing" will start to take form such that I'll know what direction to head professionally when I start interviewing.

Folks tend to treat layoffs as a tragedy / disaster / panic situation, but I'm really trying to not take that mindset and rather, treat it as an opportunity. For me, this is an opportunity to recharge, reset and get ready for the next professional opportunity!
