![Overview](/static/img/mitc2-1.jpg)

[In the Summer of 2022](https://www.cmz.dev/posts/a-month-in-the-country-1/), my family and I traveled across the United States from Washington State to the Midwest. Our goal with the trip was to get across the country to see our family; not necessarily for scenic driving, so we drove primarily on interstate highways; I-90, mostly. You might imagine that this would equate to boring driving, and you would mostly be correct! 

__Pro-tip:__ if you want a scenic, leisurely road trip, and you have plenty of time to stop at destinations, then pull out the [Rand McNally Road Atlas - Adventure Edition](https://www.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Road-Atlas-Adventure/dp/0792289897), and plot a course that follows scenic US and state highways (which are almost never interstates).

All that said, in my opinion, boring can be a __good__ thing, especially in these days of non-stop information bombardment. It almost forces you into a meditative state, and you start to become used to the drive, moving back and forth as you pass trucks, move over for stopped vehicles, and so on.

Being in the front seat, my spouse and I watched as the scenery changed, along with the various places we drove through. I will say that, overall, the West was more interesting than the Midwest from a landscape perspective. However, when you get off the interstates, the Midwest has plenty of roadside attractions, parks and natural areas to check out, which equates to just as much cool stuff to do as the West.

While we were looking out the window, our kids spent a good deal of time on screens. We didn't want our kids on screens the entire drive, so we had to come up with some boredom busters; there were many sessions of I Spy, license plate scavenger hunting, letter-and-number scavenger hunting, and more. Coffee was also very helpful. Overall, the gas station coffee on the interstates was pretty good. In addition, the interstate rest areas on the entire trip were very nice; here is one just outside of Snoqualmie Pass, WA:

# Missoula, Montana

Our first couple of days were spent in Montana, which is my new favorite state, outside of Washington State. The people are super friendly and the state itself is so spectacular in terms of scenery and outdoor recreation, it is almost overwhelming; I can imagine a whole lifetime could easily be spent here exploring all there is to do. Our initial plan was to stop at Yellowstone National Park, so our first destination in getting there was Missoula. 

We set out from Seattle and had a mostly uneventful drive through Washington, the Idaho Panhandle, and finally, Missoula, MT.

If Montana is my new favorite state, Missoula is my new favorite city! This quaint, peaceful college town is set in the backdrop of beautiful mountains and rivers; with tons of trails you can walk to directly from the town center. We stayed in Missoula for two nights; one night on the way to the Midwest and one night on the way back. If you are looking for a breakfast stop, I'd recommend the 4Bs restaurant; that said on the way back, they were slammed and we had to wait awhile for our food, but this was no big deal. 

In terms of things to do, you can see this map I've taken a photo of, or head to the [Destination Missoula Site](https://destinationmissoula.org/interactive-map).

Speaking of trails, notice the giant 'M' in the photo above. This is a thing in Montana; many of the cities and towns you drive through put the first letter of the town name or school name up on a nearby mountain. In this case, there is a trail leading from the center of town to the 'M', which was built by University of Montana students in the early 1900s. 

Given there was a trail leading from our hotel right to the 'M;, [naturally, I had to run up to it](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/montana/the-m-trail--2)! 

Here is the proof (__Please pardon my sweat-soaked shirt and exhausted-looking expression!__ ):

![The M](/static/img/mitc2-4.jpg)

I'm not going to lie; running from the center of town up to the 'M' was no joke. It was a roughly 600 ft climb in elevation, and really will get your heart pumping. However, the grade is gradual, and it was very runnable, so before I knew it, I was at the M. Here's a nice dedication at the trailhead:

Coming back down off the M, I hooked up with the Milwaukee rail trail which was refreshingly flat and extremely awesome; it runs parallel to the river and next to some interesting rock formations.

I wondered if this trail was the same as the [Palouse to Cascades Rail Trail in Washington](https://www.parks.wa.gov/521/Palouse-to-Cascades), so I did some research and sure enough, it was!

You will notice that Cedar Falls is one of the Washington stops, which is the entrance to Palouse to Cascades in North Bend, WA. 

Given that the trail runs all the way across Washington, this makes me think that it might be possible to ride this trail all the way to Chicago someday, if it is ever completely converted to rail trail across all of the states. It was fascinating to me that I was running on a trail that I could potentially turn around on and run or ride my back back to Washington if I wanted to.

The University of Montana looked like a really nice university; refreshingly smaller than the big state schools in the Midwest. It made me nostalgic for my undergrad days and spending lazy summer nights with my significant other. There also was a really nice looking library in town; it looked like it was always in use, even at 9 in the morning when it opened.

This sort of thing makes me hopeful for America's public libraries and the fact that people love to learn and come to central gathering places to read, do research and ponder life's mysteries.

# Conclusion

Our next stop coming out of Missoula was West Yellowstone, MT, so look for an upcoming post detailing that adventure. 

Happy Trails, wherever they may take you.
