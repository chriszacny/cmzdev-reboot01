One of my favorite novels I've read is J.L. Carr's "A Month in the Country." It depicts a month-long snapshot of a man's life, set in a country village in the UK. 

I like the book not only because of the beautiful imagry that the author presents, but also because it is so relatable in terms of our own summer lives; for example, hiking in the mountains and feeling the warm sun on your skin, taking a swim in the pool, or going for a nice long bike ride.

In this post I will depict my family's "month in the country", so to speak, and the adventures we've had. 

Early in 2022 we decided it would be a good idea to try a road trip from Washington to the Midwest US where most of our family is. We normally fly; after all, it is only a four hour flight to Indianapolis from Seattle, which equates to a really easy trip. 

However, in this year's case, coming off of Covid, and having kids that are appoaching teenage years, we figured it would be good to get in a trip where we could (mostly) comfortably share a hotel room together for weeks on end.

As a prelude, I'll give you a quick snapshot of where I am now. It is 7:30AM EST, and I'm sitting on my sister-in-laws 20 acre property in central Indiana watching the sun come up over the trees. I would argue that this is just as beautiful and full of nature as any mountaintop in Washington state (although don't get me wrong, I love hiking to the top of Granite Mountain as much as the next person).

"Indiana?!" you say. That's right; take a look at these photos!
