One of my favorite novels I've read is J.L. Carr's "A Month in the Country." It depicts a month-long snapshot of a man's life, set in a country village in the UK. 

I like the book not only because of the beautiful imagery that the author presents, but also because it is so relatable in terms of our own summer lives; for example, hiking in the mountains and feeling the warm sun on your skin, taking a swim in the pool, or going for a nice long bike ride.

In this series of posts I will depict my family's "Month in the Country", so to speak, and the adventures we've had. 

Early in 2022 we decided it would be a good idea to try a USA road trip from Seattle to the Midwest where most of our family is. We normally fly; after all, it is only a four hour flight to Indianapolis from Seattle, which equates to a really easy trip. However, in this year's case; both coming off of Covid, and having kids that are approaching teenage years, we figured it would be good to try and develop an appreciation for the vastness of the US and all of the cool stuff there is to do (yes, even in the Great Plains states!). We also figured it was time to put our venerable Subaru Forester to the test (apparently these are supposed to be road-tripping vehicles). Overall the goals were to make some memories, and hopefully have some fun along the way.

As a prelude, I'll give you a quick snapshot of where I am now. It is 7:30AM EST, and I'm sitting on my sister/brother-in-law's 20 acre property in central Indiana watching the sun come up over the trees. I would argue that this is just as beautiful and full of nature as any mountain top in Washington state (although don't get me wrong, I love hiking to the top of Granite Mountain as much as the next person).

"Indiana?!" you say. That's right; take a look at these photos!

The cool thing about 20 acres of land is that you can build a network of trails throughout the property, which is exactly what my brother/sister-in-law did; hence leading to some wonderful walks and trail runs throughout the property; in fact, I went on a run totalling seven miles without stepping on a county road!

My hope with this quick little prelude, is that I've given you a quick glimpse into some of the beauty of this area and inspire you to also go experience your month in the country, wherever you might be in this amazing world. Stay tuned for a longer exposition detailing our route and various areas we spent time in.
